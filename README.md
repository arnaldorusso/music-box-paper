Print your own strips for DIY music boxes.

What's a DIY music box?
-----------------------

It's a music box mechanism.  But instead of winding a spring-loaded
mechanism, it plays a tune as you crank the little handle.  And
instead of a pre-set tune, you get to punch holes in paper strips to
tell it what notes to play and when!

Where have these things been all my life?

I don't know.  I first heard about these via a couple of Vi Hart
videos:
